## Summary

This is my first project of my self-taught programmer journey and its about TIME!

***Curtain Raise Reveal*** With this classy digital clock app up on your third moniter you may never have to look at your watch, phone, computer clock, wall clock, car clock or desk clock ever again!


Dev Notes: The Font choice was nice. The color scheme choice is debateable. The functionality is 8/10 as times like 10:08:20 come out as 10:8:20.
